# 4 Expressions

An expression is part of a statement or a part of another expression. Every expression has a return type that can be used in another expression (where applicable).
Expressions with the return type `sl.types::void` cannot be used in another expression, as they hold no value.

Following types of expressions exist:

* Operator expression ([](4-1-Operator-expressions.md))
* Calling expression ([](4-2-Calling-expressions.md))
* Array access expression ([](4-3-Array-access-expressions.md))
* Identifier expression ([](4-4-Identifier-expressions.md))
* String expression ([](4-5-String-expressions.md))
* Anonymous function expression ([](4-6-Anonymous-function-expressions.md))
* Number expression ([](4-7-Number-expressions.md))
