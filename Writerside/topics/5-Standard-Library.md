# 5 Standard Library (sl)

The standard library located in the
`sl` namespace contains all the standard functions, variables, classes, etc. of Karo.

Some of these elements don't have a provided implementation and rely on implementation from the parser. These are marked with the
`[TBD]` attribute.

This specification will not cover the standard library in detail. Instead, the attachments contain a ZIP file containing basic source code files of the standard library with comments and explanations on the implementation.

## 5.1 Definitions

<primary-label ref="ns"/>
The files inside the ZIP-File at the start contain a definition on how functions could be implemented. These definitions are non-normative and are just used as a guide for a possible implementation.
