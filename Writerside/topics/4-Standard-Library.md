# 4 Standard Library (sl)

The standard library located in the `sl` namespace contains all the standard functions, variables, classes, etc. of Karo.

Some of these elements don't have a provided implementation and rely on implementation from the parser. These are marked with the `[TBD]` attribute.

This specification will not cover the standard library in detail. Instead, the attachments contain a ZIP file containing basic source code files of the standard library with comments and explanations on the implementation.
